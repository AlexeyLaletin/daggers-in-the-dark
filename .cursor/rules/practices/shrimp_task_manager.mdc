# Shrimp Task Manager (MCP)

**Purpose:** Keep multi-step work structured and auditable: break requests into tasks, track progress, and close the loop.

**Applies:** Always.

## Required workflow

- **When a user request is non-trivial (2+ steps)**: create/update a Shrimp task plan before implementing.
- **During implementation**: keep task statuses updated (in progress / done) as you work.
- **Before finishing**: ensure all Shrimp tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled.

## Repo conventions

- **MCP server config** lives in `.cursor/mcp.json` and registers `shrimp-task-manager`.
- **Task data directory** is `.shrimp/` at repo root and **must not be committed**.

## Notes

- If Shrimp tools are unavailable in a given environment, fall back to the built-in task tracking approach, but keep the same discipline (clear todos, one in-progress at a time, close tasks).
